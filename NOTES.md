# Notes

Personal notes to keep track of stuff while I'm working on getting this up and running.

## Steps

1.  Create IAM role
    'AWS Service'
    Start with 'Step Functions' use case

    role name: transcribe-workflow-experiment

1.  Create bucket
    Called: transcribe-workflow-experiment
1.  Configure bucket
    Once created, click on bucket then click on 'Properties'
    Scroll down to Event notifications and under 'Amazon EventBridge' click Edit -> Enable

1.  Create Lambda Functions
    First one: transcribe-workflow-start-job
    Second one: transcribe-workflow-cleanup-job

1.  Create a Step Function state machine

        Add two lambda functions and map them to new functions above
        On the 2nd function, select 'Wait for Callback'
        name: transcribe-workflow-statemachine
        Create new role
        Set logging to All for debugging
        --- > Add AmazonTranscribeFullAccess (good idea? maybe)

    1. Edit step function create transcribe job

        ```json
        "Parameters": {
            "Media": {
                "MediaFileUri.$": "$.mediaS3Link"
            },
            "TranscriptionJobName.$": "$$.Execution.Name",
            "LanguageCode": "en-US"
        }
        ```

1.  Event Bridge

        We'll use default event bridge for this.  You could create custom bus but we'll use the default

        Create some rules

        1. Rule 1:
            Name: transcribe-workflow-experiment-new-file
            Description: Notifies Step Function there is a new audio file in S3 in the '/uploads' key
            Event bus: default
            Enable the rule
            Rule Type: Rule with an event pattern

            Event Source: AWS events or EventBridge partner events
            Sample Event: search for S3 Object created to get sample event for later
            Sample Event will look like:

            ```json
            {
                "version": "0",
                "id": "17793124-05d4-b198-2fde-7ededc63b103",
                "detail-type": "Object Created",
                "source": "aws.s3",
                "account": "123456789012",
                "time": "2021-11-12T00:00:00Z",
                "region": "ca-central-1",
                "resources": ["arn:aws:s3:::example-bucket"],
                "detail": {
                    "version": "0",
                    "bucket": {
                        "name": "example-bucket"
                    },
                    "object": {
                        "key": "example-key",
                        "size": 5,
                        "etag": "b1946ac92492d2347c6235b4d2611184",
                        "version-id": "IYV3p45BT0ac8hjHg1houSdS1a.Mro8e",
                        "sequencer": "00617F08299329D189"
                    },
                    "request-id": "N4N7GDK58NMKJ12R",
                    "requester": "123456789012",
                    "source-ip-address": "1.2.3.4",
                    "reason": "PutObject"
                }
            }
            ```

            Creation method: Use pattern form
            Event Source: AWS services
            AWS Service: S3
            Event Type: S3 event notification
            Specific Event: Object Created
            Specific Bucket: transcribe-workflow-experiment

            You get:

            ```json
            {
                "source": ["aws.s3"],
                "detail-type": ["Object Created"],
                "detail": {
                    "bucket": {
                        "name": ["transcribe-workflow-experiment"]
                    }
                }
            }
            ```

            But we want to trigger only on new files with key/folder of 'uploads'
            https://stackoverflow.com/questions/72725831/eventbridge-notification-on-amazon-s3-folder

            so we modify the event pattern to be:

            ```json
            {
                "source": ["aws.s3"],
                "detail-type": ["Object Created"],
                "detail": {
                    "bucket": {
                        "name": ["transcribe-workflow-experiment"]
                    },
                    "object": {
                        "key": [
                            {
                                "prefix": "uploads"
                            }
                        ]
                    }
                }
            }
            ```

            also if we want to filter on filename we can:
            https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/latest/userguide/eb-event-patterns-content-based-filtering.html#eb-filtering-suffix-matching

            But difficult to target both

        1. Select Targets
            Use AWS Service: Step Functions

1.  Create Event Bridge for Transcription done

        Name: transcribe-workflow-experiment-transcribe-complete
        Description: Triggers when a transcription is complete
        default event bus
        rule with event pattern

        Sample event: Transcribe Job State Change
        Looks like:

        ```json
        {
            "version": "0",
            "id": "999cccaa-eaaa-0000-1111-123456789012",
            "detail-type": "Transcribe Job State Change",
            "source": "aws.transcribe",
            "account": "123456789012",
            "time": "2016-12-16T20:57:47Z",
            "region": "us-east-1",
            "resources": [],
            "detail": {
                "TranscriptionJobStatus": ["COMPLETED"]
            }
        }
        ```

        TranscriptionJobStatus will be COMPLETED or FAILED

## Stuck here

well, i can't go any further because the Transcribe service has no way to store the callback token of Step Functions.
Can't put it in a tag since it's longer than 256 chars.  
So I would need to store the token with the filename in like dynamodb or something goofy

Will end up rewriting it using two lambda functions and event bridge to detect when the transcribe job is complete.
